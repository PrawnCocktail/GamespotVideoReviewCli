# GamespotVideoReviewCli

This will scrape the gamespot api and dump a csv file (seperated by semi colon) with view review info including direct video links.    
You will need to sign up for a gamespot api key to use this. https://www.gamespot.com/api/
Add your key to the source (line 81) and compile. 
The releases section https://github.com/PrawnCocktail/GamespotVideoReviewCli/releases has a csv file with view reviews up until 4th August 2020.
